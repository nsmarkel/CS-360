•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app that I developed was used to arrange priorities and notify a user of an upcoming event. This app would allow a user to input reminders or upcoming events into the app and then let the user know when it’s coming up. 
•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I made a login screen for the app that allowed users to have a profile and enter the app. From there, the app took you to a home screen that was very minimalistic. You were then able to press on a block and enter in information to be reminded of later. There were buttons that would allow you to add or delete the event as well as receive text message reminders. The minimalistic design made it easy for users to use and made the app successful.
•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I approached coding my app one section at a time. I would make a feature in the XML and then would ensure that the button did what I wanted it to before moving on to the next section. This allowed me to troubleshoot small problems and not have to troubleshoot big problems. I have always used this technique and will continue to use it in the future. 
•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I would regularly use the emulator to test my app. This is important to ensure that the code was working properly. It would also guide you on what needs to be done next as far as the development process goes. 
•	Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
During the app development process, I had a problem with the grid layout function. This forced me to manually make the grid instead of using the layout.  
•	In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I felt that I did a very good job coding the app. The login screen worked very well and I was able to program all the buttons to do what I wanted. I figured out the screen transitions and how to register button clicks. I found it fun to code all the buttons and make the data bases work.
